The auto splitter will split everytime you hit a savepoint(If you hit it twice or more on the same run it will only split once).

The reset is not recommendable unless you are going for deathless runs as when you die you will automatically go to the main screen.

I dont know much about coding and im really new to CE and autosplitters so if you find anything odd its probably
cause something went wrong on the script. Just tell me and I will try to fix it, or if you want I can give you
the info for all the pointers, values, etc. that I used.
